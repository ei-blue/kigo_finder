# What is kigo?
Haiku is a form of Japanese short poetry, and seasons are the essence of haiku.

There are mainly two rules when writing haiku:

1. Number of syllables. The poem should follow a 5-7-5 syllable pattern when read aloud. (fu-ru-i-ke-ya ka-wa-zu-to-bi-ko-mu mi-zu-no-o-to, for example)
2. Kigo (seasonal word). Each haiku should contain one "kigo (seasonal word).” There are many kigo, approved by haiku associations.

# Why use Kigo Finder?
It can often be difficult to select just the right kigo—one that follows the rules while conveying the desired image.

Maybe you already have part of your haiku, and just need to put the finishing touches on it with a kigo. For example, if you are looking for a kigo word that fits the summer vibe and contains four syllables, then "Kigo Finder" is exactly what you need.
